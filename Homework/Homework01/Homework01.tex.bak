\begin{enumerate}
  \item All horses are the same color; we can prove this by induction on the number of horses in a given set. Here's how: ``if there's just one horse then it's the same color as itself, so the basis is trivial. For the induction step, assume that there are $n$ horses numbered $1$ to $n$. By the induction hypothesis, horses $1$ through $(n-1)$ are the same color, and similarly horses $2$ through $n$ are the same color. But in the middle horses, $2$ through $(n-1)$, can't change color when they are in different groups; these are horses, not chameleons. So horses $1$ and $n$ must be the same color as well. Thus all $n$ horses are the same color; QED.'' What, if anything, is wrong with this reasoning?
  \begin{solution}
    During the induction step, when $n = 2$, there are no ``middle horses (horses $2$ through $(n-1)$)'' since $n - 1 = 1 < 2$, thus we can't say horse $1$ and horse $n$ (horse $2$) has the same color. As a result, we cannot draw the conclusion that every $2$ horses have the same color, so this induction proof is wrong.
  \end{solution}

  \item Find the shortest sequence of moves that transfers a tower of $n$ disks from the left peg A to the right peg B, if direct moves between $A$ and $B$ are disallowed. (Each move must be to or from the middle peg C. As usual, a larger disk must never appear above a smaller one.)
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
      \centering
      % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
      \includegraphics[width=3in]{hanoi.png}
    \end{figure}
  \begin{solution}
    Let's say $T_n$ is the minimum number of moves that will transfer $n$ disks from the left peg A to the right peg B under the given rules. Then $T_1$ is obvious $2$ ($A \rightarrow B$, $B \rightarrow C$), and we have $T_2 = 8$ ($A \rightarrow C$, $C \rightarrow B$, $A \rightarrow C$, $B \rightarrow C$, $C \rightarrow A$, $C \rightarrow B$, $A \rightarrow C$, $C \rightarrow B$).
     
    We have a method for transferring $n$ disks in general: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Transfer the $(n-1)$ smallest from A to B through C (requiring $T_{n-1}$ moves);
    \item Move the largest from A to C (requiring $1$ move);
    \item Transfer the $(n-1)$ smallest from B to A through C (requiring $T_{n-1}$ moves);
    \item Move the largest from C to B (requiring $1$ move);
    \item Transfer the $(n-1)$ smallest from A to B through C (requiring $T_{n-1}$ moves).
    \end{itemize}
     
    With this method, we can say that
    \begin{equation}
    T_n \leq 3T_{n-1} + 2 \quad (n > 0)
    \label{eq:2.1}
    \end{equation}
     
    Actually this is the best way. Because at some point we have to move the largest disk from A to B, and that needs 2 steps: $A \rightarrow C$ and $C \rightarrow B$. When move the largest from A to C, we have to move the $(n-1)$ smallest from A to B through C, and this taken at least $T_{n-1}$ moves; similarly, when move the largest from C to B, we have to move the $(n-1)$ smallest from B to A through C in at least $T_{n-1}$ moves. Finally, we have to move the $(n-1)$ smallest from A to B through C in at least $T_{n-1}$ moves and finish the task. Hence,
    \begin{equation}
    T_n \geq 3T_{n-1} + 2 \quad (n > 0)
    \label{eq:2.2}
    \end{equation}
     
    With Equation \eqref{eq:2.1} and Equation \eqref{eq:2.2}, we have
    \begin{equation}
    T_n = 3T_{n-1} + 2 \quad (n > 0)
    \label{eq:2.3}
    \end{equation}
     
    With Equation \eqref{eq:2.3} and $T_0 = 1$ we can draw the conclusion that
    \begin{equation}
    T_n = 3^n - 1 \quad (n \geq 0)
    \label{eq:2.4}
    \end{equation}
     
    We have proved that $T_n = 3^n - 1$ is the minimum moves to transfer $n$ disks from the left peg A to the right peg B under the given rules. And the method is also given above. With the method we are able to generate the shortest path recursively.
  \end{solution}
  
  \item Show that, in the process of transferring a tower under the restriction of the preceding exercise, we will actually encounter every properly stacked arrangement of $n$ disks on three pegs.
  \begin{solution}
    We have proved that the shortest path takes $T_n = 3^n - 1$ moves in the solution to the preceding exercise. Let us refer to ``properly stacked arrangement of $n$ disks on three pegs'' as state. Because this is the shortest path, so every state during the transferring process must be different. There are total $3^n$ possible state, and with $T_n = 3^n - 1$ move we can go through $3^n$ different state including the initial state. So we must encounter every properly stacked arrangement of $n$ disks on three pegs when we use the method in the preceding exercise.
  \end{solution}
  
  \item Are there any starting and ending configurations of $n$ disks on three pegs that are more than $2^n-1$ moves apart, under Lucas's original rules?
  \begin{solution}
    No. But why?
  \end{solution}
  
  \item A ``Venn Diagram'' with three overlapping circles is often used to illustrate the eight possible subsets associated with three given sets:
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
      \centering
      % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
      \includegraphics[width=1in]{venn.png}
    \end{figure}
    
    Can the sixteen possibilities that arise with four given sets be illustrated by four overlapping circles?
  
  \begin{solution}
    No. Two circles can have $2$ intersection points at most. When inserting the fourth circle, we can add $6$ intersection points at most. Under the best circumstance, an intersection point means a additional region, so we can have $6$ additional regions at most, that is, totally $6+8=14$ regions at most. Thus we can not illustrate all 16 possibilities that arise with four given sets by four overlapping circles.
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
